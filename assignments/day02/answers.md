# Docker Exercise
This assignment was about setting up Docker on our machines and establishing a database connection using Docker. 

## What is Docker?
Docker allows you to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, like libraries and dependencies and make it into one package. It means you can run it on any system without the interference of personalized settings or other differences between them.

## What is the difference between:
* Virtual Machine
* Docker Container
* Docker Image
A virtual machine is an entire operating system ran on your system. A container behaves similarly to a VM but instead of building an entire new OS, it only builds the neccesary components they need to operate. Docker images are snapshots of live containers. 

## Web API?
A web API is an interface containing functions or operations to access data and features of an application. 

## Postgres?
Postgres is an open source-relational database management system.

## package.json file dependencies field:
It specifies which dependencies are needed for the application to run. The right library isn't enough, it also needs the correct versions. 

## npm express package:
It's the web application framework for Node.js. It's free and open-source and used for building web apps and API's.

## npm pg package:
It's the Postgres client for JavaScript. It's free and open-source. It's used to write queries for example.

## What is docker-compose:
It's a tool for running Docker applications. You use it to configure your app's services and run them from those configurations. 

## Results
We learned how to use Docker and what Docker's purpose is. We set up a database and established a connection to it with Docker. We inserted data into it to verify it's behaving as expected and learned how to sort the returning data alphabetically, which helped our understanding of using JavaScript with a database.
